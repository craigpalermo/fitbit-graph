# fitbit-graph
Display graphs of Fitbit data exports in the browser

## TODO
- Use Bower to install front-end packages
- Add ability to choose which field to show in graph
- Support other export types, other than Activities
- Use datastore instead of saving files on disk, support persistent links to previous uploads (?)
